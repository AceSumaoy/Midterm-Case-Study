Welcome to the E-Commerce Management System! This guide will provide you with an overview of the system's features and functionalities, empowering you to effectively manage your online store.

## Objective: 
The objective of this project is to create a functional e-commerce platform where users can
browse products, add items to their cart, view their cart, remove items from their cart, and complete the
checkout process.

## Requirements
## 1. Front-End Application (React):

▪ Implement a user-friendly interface using React to allow users to interact with the e-
commerce platform.

▪ Display a list of available products fetched from the Laravel API.

▪ Allow users to add items to their shopping cart.

▪ Provide a cart view where users can see the items in their cart along with the quantity and total price.

▪ Allow users to remove items from their cart.

▪ Implement a checkout process where users can enter their shipping details and complete the purchase.

## 2. Back-End API (Laravel):

▪ Develop a RESTful API using Laravel to handle requests from the front-end application.

▪ Implement endpoints to fetch product data from the database and send it to the front end.

▪ Create endpoints to manage the shopping cart, including adding items, removing items, and updating quantities.

▪ Implement functionality to calculate the total price of the items in the cart.

## Solution Approach
## 1. Front-End Development (React):
▪ Create React components for different sections of the e-commerce platform, such as product listing, cart view, and checkout.

▪ Use React Router to handle navigation between different pages of the application.

▪ Implement state management using React Hooks to manage the state of the shopping cart and user interactions.

▪ Use Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the Laravel API and fetch data.

▪ Design the user interface to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

## 2. Back-End Development (Laravel):
▪ Set up a Laravel project with appropriate database configurations.

▪ Define models and migrations to represent products, users, and carts in the database.

▪ Implement controllers to handle incoming requests from the front end and perform necessary operations, such as fetching product data and managing the shopping cart.

▪ Use Laravel's validation features to validate incoming requests and ensure data integrity.

▪ Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints and restrict access to authenticated users only.

▪ Utilize Laravel's built-in features for handling sessions and managing user authentication.
